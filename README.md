# Wearable Computing Toolkit (Jan 2020 - May 2021)

Graphical User Interface to manage human activity recognition data for [Wearable Computing Group](https://www.jasonforsyth.net/project/physical-therapy/) @ JMU. 
Developed using tkinter and matplotlib.

Combines data streams collected from [MetaWear Sensors](https://mbientlab.com/metamotions/) into single merged file. 
GUI displays interactive plot to allow user to select ranges to assign to acitivities previously listed. Finalizes the data pipeline to capture activity data, clean/label/manage the information, and evaluate novel HAR approaches.
